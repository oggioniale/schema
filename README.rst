Medadata Schema for the Persistent Identification of Scientific Instruments
===========================================================================

The `Research Data Alliance`_ working group `Persistent Identification
of Instruments WG`_ seeks to explore a community-driven solution for
globally unique identification of active instruments in the sciences.

This repository holds the (current draft for the) medadata schema for
this PID system.
